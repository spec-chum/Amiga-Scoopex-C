# Amiga-Scoopex-C

My attempt at converting Scoopex's superb Amiga Hardware coding tutorials into C.

The toolchain I use is this one: https://github.com/BartmanAbyss/vscode-amiga-debug which has great debugging via VSCode.

Once his extension is installed, as per the simple instructions on his repo, you *should* be able to just open the folder in VSCode and press F5 to run.  *Should.*
